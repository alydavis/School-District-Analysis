# School District Analysis

## Overview
A school board requested an analysis of local high schools. The primary measure of a school's success was math and reading scores to inform high and low performing schools, and compare average scores by grade, school spending, student population size, and school type.

## Process
An initial [analysis](PyCitySchools.ipynb) was completed with the Pandas Library in Jupyter notebooks. I merged the supplied raw school and student .csv data, inspected and cleansed the data, and sorted, grouped, and summarized the data into dataframes. After the initial analysis was complete, the school board was notified of academic dishonesty for 9th grade reading and math at Thomas High School (THS). I replaced the scores of the dishonest grades at THS and updated the data analysis. The results below compare the original analysis to the [new analysis](PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb) to show the impact of these fradulent grades.

## Results
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
 - - Math and reading scores by grade
 - - Scores by school spending
 - - Scores by school size
 - - Scores by school type

## Summary
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
