# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
A school board requested an analysis of local high schools. The data set included reading and math schools for high school students at a variety of school types including District and Charter schools of varying, sizes, and budgets. The primary measure of the schools success was math and reading scores. 

## Process
After the initial [analysis](PyCitySchools.ipynb) was complete, the school board was notified of academic dishonesty for 9th grade reading and math at Thomas High School (THS). The scores of the dishonest grades at THS needed to be replace the scores with NaNs and repeat the data analysis. The results below compare the original analysis to the [new analysis](PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb) to describe the impact of these fradulent grades.

## Results
